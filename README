 * POSIX don't give uniform way to notify about errors so:
 * $ is best way for most cases but there are no guarantee that it works properly.
 * If function error code is different than 0 or -1 then it WONT be CAUGHT, by try and $.
 * Moreover POSIX let functions set errno even if its executes successfully so proper value maybe misinterpreted.
 * 
 * Also you can declare RELEASE before including this file to erase all error checks.
